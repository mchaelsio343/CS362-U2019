Here are the bugs I introduced to the UrlValidator.java file:

- line 463:
	changed && to || so isValidPath() will return false if *either*
	isOff(ALLOW_2_SLASHES) *or* slash2Count is true, instead of
	requiring both are true.

- line 419: 
	// removed Integer.parseInt, left: "int iPort = port;" in function,
	// isValidAuthority(). Not ure what the consequences of this would
	// be, because I'm not sure what kind of variable port is (if not
	// already an int [long?]) and I'm not sure how Integer.parseInt works.

	instead of removing Integer.parseInt, the try-catch block is removed. 
	As a consequence, the program will crash when UrlValidator.java
	trying to parse an large number string that is greater than the maximum
	integer in Java, such as 999999999999999999 . 

- lines 476-478 (from original code):
	removed entire conditional statement:
	"if(query == null) {
		return true;
	}" from isValidQuery(). I'm guessing this will lead to otherwise
	valid queries (that are null, because queries can be null) to
	return false.

The directions for Part-B say to introduce two bugs for the unit test and
one bug for the random test, so if you want to return one of these bugs to
it's original, functioning state while you perform the unit test, please do.
